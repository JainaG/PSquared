  <h3>What is Cognitive Psychology?</h3>
  <h4>Cognitive psychology is the study of the processes in the mind</h4>

  <p><strong><i>Memory in 4 steps:</i></strong>
    <ol>
    <li> Attention
        <ul>
        <li>Lets important information into our brain while leaving unimportant information out</li>
        </ul>
     </li>
     <li> Encoding
          <ul>
          <li>As sensory information comes in brain processes it</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Sounds become words</li>
                <li>Light and color become images</li>
              </ul>
          <li>The brain begins making connections between this new piece of information and old pieces of information</li>
          <li>Some new pieces of information may stay while others may fade</li>
          </ul>
     </li>
     <li>Storage
          <ul>
          <li>Long term storage of information requires brain connections</li>
          <li>Brain rehearses experiences (ie. through dreams) to strengthen brain connections</li>
          <li>Repetition of information also helps strengthen brain connections</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Hence the saying: "Practice Makes Perfect"</li>
              </ul>
          </ul>
     </li>
     <li>Retrieval
         <ul>
          <li>Process of accessing stored memories</li>
          <li>Used when we recall a fact or reimagine an experience</li>
          <li>Helps us connect new information to old information</li>
         </ul>
     </li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  <p><strong><i>Types of Memory</i></strong>
      <ol>
      <li>Sensory Memory</li>
        <ul>
        <li>Quick flash of everything that our sensory systems take in (eyes, ears, nose, etc.)</li>
        <li>Most information fades away</li>
        <li>Duration: few tenths of a second up to a second</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Working Memory</li>
        <ul>
        <li>Helps us carry out a task, achieve a goal, or solve a problem</li>
        <li>Temporary mental workspace to bring together information from short term and long term memory</li>
          <ol>
          <li>Example #1: Mental Math</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Using multiplication rules stored in long term memory to multiply numbers stored in short term memory</li>
          </ul>
          </ol>
        <li>Using skills and information stored in long term memory but learning and reacting to new information as we experience it</li>
        <li>Helps us...</li>
        <ol>
          <li>Control our attention</li>
          <li>Take in more important information while dialing out distractions</li>
          <li>Helps us keep things in our mind long enough for them to be processed</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Process = moving things from sensory memory to short term memory to long term memory</li>
        <li>Working memory and attention have a limited capacity</li>
        <li>Only so many things we can attend to at the same time</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Short Term Memory</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Holds onto 4-9 pieces of information at one time</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Ex. Remembering phone number long enough to dial it</li>
          </ul>
          <li>If information is given enough attention, it may be converted to long term memory</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Most information fades</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Duration: Few seconds to a minute</li>
        </ul>
    <li>Long Term Memory</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Thought of as “permanent storage”</li>
          <ul>
            <li>However some fade over time</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Events associated with a strong emotion or memorized through repetition are more likely to stick</li> "ADD STICKING PICTURE HERE"
          <ul>
            <li>Example: Random pieces of information are more likely to fade, for instance what you had for breakfast on March 25th, 2020 </li>
          </ul>
          <li>Duration: Hours to Decades</li>
          <li>Three types:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Episodic</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Event based memory</li>
              <li>Mental record of things that you have experienced or observed in your surroundings </li>
              <li>Includes sights, sounds, thoughts, feelings associated with event you are thinking about</li>
              <li>Ex. Watching Fantasy Island with your friends and laughing during one of the scary parts of the movie</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Semantic</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Collection of facts</li>
              <li>Not associated with any feelings</li>
              <li>Most likely pieces of factual information for school or work</li>
              <li>Ex. Multiplication tables or grammar rules</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Procedural</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Includes things that are task/skill based</li>
              <li>Includes “muscle memory” for things like riding a bike or playing an instrument</li>
              <li>Helps us learn cause and effect</li>
              <li>Information about foods that make us sick or actions that have certain consequences</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
   </p>

   <p><strong><i>What is Sleep</i></strong>
     <ul>
       <li>Semi-conscious state of mind during which your breathing slows down, blood pressure decreases, muscles relax, and body temperature drops</li>
     </ul>
