  <h2>What is Cognitive Psychology?</h2>
  <h4>Cognitive psychology is the study of the processes in the mind</h4>
  <p>Memory in 4 steps
    <ol>
    <li> Attention
        <ul>
        <li>Lets important information into our brain while leaving unimportant information out</li>
        </ul>
     </li>
     <li> Encoding
          <ul>
          <li>As sensory information comes in brain processes it</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Sounds become words</li>
                <li>Light and color become images</li>
              </ul>
          <li>The brain begins making connections between this new piece of information and old pieces of information</li>
          <li>Some new pieces of information may stay while others may fade</li>
          </ul>
     </li>
     <li>Storage
          <ul>
          <li>Long term storage of information requires brain connections</li>
          <li>Brain rehearses experiences (ie. through dreams) to strengthen brain connections</li>
          <li>Repetition of information also helps strengthen brain connections</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Hence the saying: "Practice Makes Perfect"</li>
              </ul>
          </ul>
     </li>
     <li>Retrieval
         <ul>
          <li>Process of accessing stored memories</li>
          <li>Used when we recall a fact or reimagine an experience</li>
          <li>Helps us connect new information to old information</li>
         </ul>
     </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>Types of Memory
      <ol>
      <li>Sensory Memory</li>
        <ul>
        <li>Quick flash of everything that our sensory systems take in (eyes, ears, nose, etc.)</li>
        <li>Most information fades away</li>
        <li>Duration: few tenths of a second up to a second</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Working Memory</li>
        <ul>
        <li>Helps us carry out a task, achieve a goal, or solve a problem</li>
        <li>Temporary mental workspace to bring together information from short term and long term memory
          <ol>
          <li>Example #1: Mental Math</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Using multiplication rules stored in long term memory to multiply numbers stored in short term memory</li>
          </ul>
          </ol>
        <li>Using skills and information stored in long term memory but learning and reacting to new information as we experience it</li>
        <li>Helps us...</li>
        <ol>
          <li>Control our attention</li>
          <li>Take in more important information while dialing out distractions</li>
          <li>Helps us keep things in our mind long enough for them to be processed</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Process = moving things from sensory memory to short term memory to long term memory</li>
        <li>Working memory and attention have a limited capacity</li>
        <li>Only so many things we can attend to at the same time</li>
        </ul>
      </ol>
